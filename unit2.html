        • 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page

    </h1>
<p>
    The content meets the purpose, providing the information of my both units on different tabs, 
    and also about me page where you learn more about me personally. The layout is designed well and consistent, 
    keeping to a set tone of having a title with a subtext. There is also often image[s] found on each tab you select.

<h1>
    • 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.

</h1>

<p>
    Companies are always making copyright claims in order to protect their work. 
    Often these claims are made without any other intention other than to try and sue somebody to make a quick buck. 
    Often in terms of content, it can be used with given permission.
     This however can be complicated for example them not getting into contact with you.
      This of course restricts the publisher of the website on what they may post.
       To get around this, as mentioned, they may have to get credit and/or post a reference to the content that is used.

</p>

<h1>
    • 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities
     may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them.

</h1>

<p>
    People with certain disabilities can cover a wide range of factors. Over 1 billion people suffer with some sort of disability.
     If a website has some form of video media, it is important to provide subtitles and transcripts to provide for people with hearing predicament. 
     Users with vision problems also may struggle if the website is crammed with images then they generally can’t be able to cope.
      Also with text, font, colour scheme and also its layout all contribute too. 
      However, with text this can be averted with a screen reader tool so it’s important this is tested to read out the correct information.
       It may read the wrong information if text isn’t laid out correctly. Users can also find websites overwhelming if it doesn’t keep its structure.
        For example, one page being a completely different design to what they were previously on.
         This can be averted with keeping a maintaining consistency. The website should also have clear headings and buttons making sure they work
          all correctly for people who often suffer with navigation issues.

<h1>
        1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites.


</h1>

<p>
        Websites are often in .HTML format. This means I must name the file to the correct file format.
         Images are often used in my image too, in my scenario, it is .png’s and/or .jpeg’s. However,
          we can use other popular formats such as SVG and GIF. Jpeg is often the popular choice, 
          the reason for it to be the most popular is due to its wide range of colours it can be saved on,
           over 16 million! Therefore, if often your images are have complex colours and shading 
           JPEG won’t fail in delivering in it’s compression to your website.

        PNG’s also supports a wide range of colours, however it depends which one we 
        are talking about as there are two different PNG’s formats. PNG-8 and PNG-24.
         PNG-8’s are capable of supporting upto 256 colours and PNG-24 has an unlimited
          amount. They are often suited for when your website has a lot of graphics and/or 
          text. PNG’s often don’t compress too much, maintaining the original file quality.
        
        We can also use gif’s. Gif’s are good to use for banners, what makes them different to 
        the other formats is that they can be animated as they are raster based. The quality isn’t
        as good, however they are useful for making little clips. They are often used on the internet
         for what is known to be called as “memes” but perhaps may be irrelevant in website design, in most cases.
        
        The last one, SVG is a vector format, therefore they’re not using any pixels, rather lines and shapes.
         As they’re not pixels, they are good for reshaping without losing any quality whatsoever.
