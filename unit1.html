    Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
   </h1> 

   <p>
    In the modern world, IT tends to cover most areas of the field. Infact, 
    in this age, it is hard to imagine a business (or at least a successful one) 
    that doesn’t use its use. The main reason for this is IT greatly benefits a business in order to succeed. 
    This can cover a whole range of forms of business. 
    For example, such big business with their such massive data to hold needs to be organised efficiently and also for it to 
    obtain effective and quick processing for a wide range of purposes from decision
     making to risk management. Business on an international level, information is always disputed from all areas of the globe.
      IT would be used in this example as a form of communications of managing all sorts of data. In essence, the more the business grows,
       the more it becomes reliable on technology.
   </p>




   

    

       <h1>
        - 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – 
        what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
       </h1>

       <p>
        Firstly, we should talk about what exactly is a digital project.
         They are the transformations of objects such as texts and images which are in forms of specialised, enhanced or remote analysis. 
         In terms of skills, one must be consistent on being able to manage their projects for example their schedules, budgets, reports and agendas. 
         Tools needed are mainly forms of communications, a good example would be a tool named “Workplace”.

       </p>

       <h1>
        - 1.3  Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.

       </h1>

       <p>
        I already have a brief idea in my head on designing my website, however this needs to be planned within notes and diagrams. 
        I have to have a brief summary of what is needed to be included in the website. The mains points I will highlight are my skills, 
        availability and areas of work and show how I made the page which as mentioned, would highlight my skills in action. 
        Please find attached a link to my Trello board: https://trello.com/b/iyaDr6YV/codenation


       </p>

       <h1>
        -1.4  Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?

       </h1>

       <p>
        Often digital projects tend to fail due to lack of management. 
        Let me go into further detail, 
        one may not feel engaged in his work and will result in everything to collapse or a lack of communication between members.
        One example could be developing a website, often it has a team of coders, 
        therefore communication on the subject is often important because if their code doesn’t match it simply won’t run. Even one letter.


       </p>

       <h1>
        -1.5  Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –
         how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?

       </h1>

       <p>
        Often my preferred choice of software would be Windows.
         However, it is possible to even completing such tasks within MacOS and Linux. 
         I would use programmes such as Python for my coding, GitHub and Trello to keep myself organized and efficient in my work. 
         For website design, of course I have conducted this website within the program of Visual Studio.

       </p>

       <h1>
        -1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. 
        – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.

       </h1>

       <p>
          Trello helps me as it is a great collaboration tool. 
          This allows me to plan my projects clearly in a nice kan-ban style interface.
           It also allowed me to track my time, as I created 3 different tables one being to do, doing, and done.
            GitHub has also been a great as it’s where I’ve uploaded my code and also found help from there from the ever growing community. 
            I found many answers on this website,
             and even some posted some custom fonts I could to further enhance my website to my own personal liking.


       </p>

       <h1>
        -1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?

       </h1>

       <p>
          The GDPR has set clear guidelines on the rights of data protection.
           It impacts projects as it protects the right of data management to all EU citizens. 
           This can impact digital projects because you need to have an understanding of the reglerations and also follow its guidelines. 
           It impacts greatly in terms of knowing the rules, by playing by those rules, 
           it forces them to give an oath to protect and to use their information appropriately. 
           It mostly points out the rights of the individual, such digital projects such as a website, 
           if they agree to something it has to clear in the fineprint. People who do want to fill something out,
            for example a newsletter it has to be a clear form of the user filling in their information in order to be compliant.

       </p>

       <h1>
        • 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website,
         are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello

       </h1>

       <p>
          I am satisfied with my final results, the website looks clean and contains all the text that is to be provided. 
          It displays content, and shows off good use of code. I am happy with VSC, 
          I believe it is the best platform out there for coding, it is also the most popular to this date. 
          It also gives really good suggestions, for example. When I perhaps know a code to enter but don’t know it from the top of my head,
           it often suggests the full length of the code; if I click that, it will provide me with the full code that I needed. 
           This is a great help to why I like using VSC. Trello was very helpful as it allowed me to plan my projects,
            this is something very important on a bigger scale. Of course there’s many other tools as such, however 
            Trello is has a sleek kan-ban interface which I am very fond of.


       </p>

       <h1>
        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.
       </h1>

       <p>
          Yes, VSC is the most popular coding program out there so I believe it was the right tool to use in terms of research.
           It was also basic to understand and didn’t get any more completed then it needed to be. 
           Trello was appropriate because it allowed me to track my projects, without it, such tasks to complete would be very overwhelming. 

       </p>

       <h1>
        • 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not?
         You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?

       </h1>

       <p>

        I always had these great in my mind which I felt I couldn’t implement in terms of how far my coding skills could go. 
        In terms of what I would like to change, I would make it more stylish with CSS if I had more of a found basis on it.
         I also wish I knew some sort of easier to positioning my text without the code becoming too complicated. 
         In essence, I am happy with my website,
          I feel I did a good job at it, as I thought at first originally it would be a unit that would be very overwhelming. 
          The thought of originally creating a website felt very overwhelming, as you can see from inspect element the complications a website can be. 
          However, I feel it wasn’t as hard as imagined and conducted a good job. 


       </p>

       <h1>
         2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.

       </h1>

       <p>
        Further improvement would be the positioning of text and images.
         Also more complete code would be ideal to further enhance the website making
          it more unique to me and my work. Also, if 
          I had the knowledge I would have shown off a bigger picture of my ideas and thoughts.
           Also, another improvement could be to keep more constiancy on my pages with the same amount of text on them.


       </p>

       <h1>
         2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.

       </h1>

       <p>
        My outcome is to present a website created in Visual Studio Code, providing all information about the course, 
        the units and it to run correctly. The purpose of creating this website is to simple show my lines of code 
        and how much of a presentable website I can create. I believe with what I conducted, meets my target. 
        This is because the website runs correctly and provides all the information that is needed given.


       </p>

       <h1>
        • 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency 
        – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? 

       </h1>

       <p>
          Perhaps I could have kept more of a structure, however I feel the website is created quite professional. 
          The drawbacks of IT tools of course would be the complication with code which indeed takes time to learn, 
          however there isn’t much of an alternative and is needed in order to run an HTML. The benefits of using these tools
           is being able to maintain a website, also they can be used to gain knowledge on that sector; often when I’ve struggled to
            know how to complete a specific line of code, I could use websites in order to give me a better understanding.
             Often posted by the wide range of the coding community, this helps greatly because it gives me a form of guidance.
              The most popular site to use is often GitHub. There are many others, but this is the most prevalent. 


       </p>

       <h1>
        3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.
       </h1>

       <p>
          Keeping a structure, using Tevallo will help greatly with such sorts.
           Keeping a mindset on the tasks given will provide me to achieve the best possible outcome on what I can achieve.
            To achieve this outcome, it is important to keep on track on time I’m spending on specific tasks, 
            taking regular breaks to maintain concentration, this also includes a good amount of sleep for the next day.
            Also, using Trello, it can be used to set self imposed deadlines and utilising these tools has come of great help. 
            This is something that helped greatly achieving these tasks to get the best outcome I could possibly achieve.


       </p>

       <h1>
        3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects
         – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?

       </h1>

       <p>
          I believe I should have worked more in a team and not feel nervous to suggest my ideas and thoughts.
           Although I don’t feel like it affected my work as such, it would of been something to show more of my character.
            I also as suggested could of used slack more, as it’s available on all devices making it very convenient  
            The use of Slack is also important because it is a form of communications to the team. Although the work is independent, 
            there is nothing wrong in sharing each others ideas in order to learn from one another. This will result in productivity and gaining 
            the best outcome not only for me but also fellow students of the course.



       </p>

       <h1>
        • 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 

       </h1>

       <p>
          I would test the fluidity of the website, looking for any known issues that could occur, giving a full diganoises.
           I would also check the line of code that all is in order, as simple mistakes can occur. Examples would be is checking all the
            links are correct, testing webpage cookies, validating the HTML and CSS and testing the database. The website should be easy to use,
             with the main menu on each page, with the text being very clear and in place. Simply running the HTML page after running it and you
              can give your own analysis. To go more in depth, you can use SEO tools to gather a full diagnosis. For example, some SEO tools 
              will tell you how many H1 tags, if there’s a meta description etc.
