<p>
    My name is Callum Jack Price, I have studied a vast majority of my time in the factors of
     IT during both my education and workplace. I studied general IT at college however it 
     never went into full brief of the aspects of coding. This is where CodeNation came into place;
      I wanted to vastly improve my career by gaining knowledge in the field. I saw the promotion on
       Instagram where I felt it was an opportunity I couldn’t ignore. CodeNation within these two
        weeks has taught me a lot, learning many different aspects and the wide range that coding does have within the factor.
        Throughout my working career, I have maintained and developed a desire to learn, achieve and succeed.
I am a highly self motivated individual that trusts myself to meet challenges, find solutions and achieve best practice in any situation.
From a workplace environment of working with others, working under pressure, a keenness to learn new skills to work in a team and contribute towards successful activities. I have looked to improve personally and actively embrace new roles with a determination to achieve the best performance possible.
